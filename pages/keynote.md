### Research director of the SODA team at Inria, and director of the scikit-learn operations at Inria foundation
#### Topic of the talk to be announced

**Biography.** Gaël Varoquaux is a research director working on data science at Inria (French computer science national research) where he leads the Soda team. Varoquaux's research covers fundamentals of artificial intelligence, statistical learning, natural language processing, causal inference, as well as applications to health, with a current focus on public health and epidemiology. He also creates technology: he co-funded scikit-learn, one of the reference machine-learning toolboxes, and helped build various central tools for data analysis in Python. Varoquaux has worked at UC Berkeley, McGill, and university of Florence. He did a PhD in quantum physics supervised by Alain Aspect and is a graduate from Ecole Normale Superieure, Paris.


## Laure Fournier ![Portrait of Laure Fournier](/images/keynote/laure_fournier.png){: width="180" }
### Radiologist, Hôpital Européen Georges Pompidou and INSERM 
#### Topic of the talk to be announced

**Biography.** Dr Laure Fournier works as a Professor at the Hôpital Européen Georges Pompidou, in Paris, France. Her time is divided between clinical work on urogenital cancers, and imaging research in the Laboratoire de Recherche en Imagerie (INSERM U970). She works on functional imaging, radiomics and big data, to extract quantitative parameters from images reflecting tumour physiology and biology, more specifically to define response to therapy, particularly for targeted therapies requiring new response criteria. She organises the curriculum on Artificial Intelligence for French radiology residents. She is a member of the Scientific Committee of the DRIM France IA national image database and is a medical imaging chair in the PRAIRIE interdisciplinary AI institute. She has been involved in outreach activities including round tables with clinicians and policy makers, meetings and interviews with patients and general public on the subject of patient databases, radiomics and AI.

## Karim Lekadir ![Portrait of Karim Lekadir](/images/keynote/karim_lekadir.png){: width="180" }
### ICREA research professor, department of mathematics and computer science at the University of Barcelona
#### Topic of the talk to be announced

**Biography.** Karim Lekadir is an ICREA Research Professor in the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Barcelona. He obtained his PhD from Imperial College London and was a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford University. He investigates new data science techniques for trustworthy and ethical artificial intelligence in medicine. He has been PI in 12 EU-funded projects, coordinated 5 Horizon projects, and was awarded an ERC Consolidator grant to investigate new AI techniques tailored to resource-limited settings. In addition, Karim is General Chair for the MICCAI 2024 Conference (Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention) which for the first time will take place in Africa – in Marrakesh, Morocco.
