## Submission Instructions

We will be using [openreview.net](https://openreview.net) as a submission and reviewing platform.

<!-- Short papers are **strictly limited to 3 pages (excluding references)** and can, for example, focus on novel methodological ideas without extensive validation. We also specifically accept short papers discussing recently published or submitted journal contributions to give authors the opportunity to present their work and obtain feedback from conference attendees. Selection of short papers is based on a light **(single-blind)** review process via OpenReview. All accepted short papers will be presented at the conference. -->

Full papers contain methodological developments or well-validated applications of deep learning algorithms in medical imaging. The paper length is **limited to 8** pages excluding references, acknowledgments and appendix sections. There is no page limit for the references and appendices, but reviewers are not obliged to evaluate any content included in an appendix section. The papers will go through a full, **single-blind** reviewing process via OpenReview. A selection of full papers will be invited for oral presentation. All accepted full papers will be published in the [Proceedings of Machine Learning Research](http://proceedings.mlr.press/).

To submit a paper, authors need to have an updated [OpenReview account](https://openreview.net/profile).

Inquiries to the program chairs can be addressed directly to [pc@2024.midl.io](mailto:pc@2024.midl.io).

## Rebuttal and Discussion

Authors are expected to submit a comprehensive rebuttal addressing the comments raised by the reviewers during the rebuttal period. In order to fully address the comments of the reviewers, the authors are free to modify or add any additional details, experiments or images that might be required in their paper. It is important to keep in mind however that the page limit is 8 pages for the main paper excluding references, acknowledgements and the appendix sections. After the rebuttal, a discussion period will start on which the authors and reviewers will have the chance to interact. Î¤he reviewers will be able to see all answers when submitted and can potentially provide feedback. However, it is expected that during the discussion period, the reviewers will be more committed and responsive to your answers. The discussion is a unique feature of MIDL, and we recommend taking full advantage of it, as it tends to improve paper outcomes.

## MELBA special issue

The best papers of the conference will be invited to submit a journal extension to a [special issue in the MELBA journal](https://www.melba-journal.org/blog/013-midl-melba-2024.html).
